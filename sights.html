            Whale watching
    </h2>
    <p class="textmall">
        In the course of the most recent twenty years, Iceland has gotten one of Europe's head whale-watching
        objections.
        Whale watching is as fundamental a piece of any outing to Iceland as seeing the Northern Lights, Hot Springs,
        and Glaciers.
        Whales are huge sea-going warm blooded creatures, otherwise called cetaceans.<br> <br>
        A few civilizations, including Icelanders, are referred to have pursued them since as ahead of schedule as 875
        AD.
        Today whaling is a less critical industry, and the sea's delicate monsters are considered more to be a vacation
        spot

    <h2>The Blue Lagoon</h2>
    <p class="textmall">
        The Blue Lagoon is one of Iceland's most popular attractions, and it's little wonder as to why.
        The beautiful milky-blue water is unlike anything else found on earth and makes a stark contrast to the
        surrounding black lava fields and creeping grey moss.
        The water sits at 39°C (102°F) year-round, making it the perfect bathing temperature.

        <h2>Geysir</h2>
        <p class="textmall">

            Geysir is one of the principal attractions on Iceland's most famous touring visit, the Golden Circle.
            The entirety of the world's rambling underground aquifers are named after Geysir in Iceland - in all
            dialects other than Icelandic, "geysir" names the wonder.
            In Icelandic, it's simply the name of that solitary spring, and albeit the word alludes to all fountains
            when all is said in done, there's only one genuine Geysir and that is the one in south-west Iceland.
            The main stories of the Great Geysir date back to the year 1294 when an incredible quake shook the southern
            swamps of Iceland and changed the geothermal territory in Haukadalur valley.
            Reports found in the composed chronicles expressing that "huge natural aquifers" were shaped, are presently
            thought to demonstrate that the underground aquifers began to ramble.
