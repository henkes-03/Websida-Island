                Iceland is surrounded by the sea, so it’s no surprise that fish and seafood are an important part of Icelandic cuisine.
                 Most traditional Icelandic food revolves around fish, dairy products, bread, potatoes and lamb.
                  The roots of Icelandic cuisine come from Scandinavian cuisine after the Vikings of Northern Europe settled there in
                   the 9th century and thereafter. Today, restaurants in Reykjavik and other cities widely serve food from all over the
                    world. Many restaurants specialize in seafood, focusing on product quality rather than traditional cooking methods. 
                    Classic icelandic foods: kjötsúpa, Harðfiskur, skyr, pylsur, brennivín, hákarl, Rúgbrauð.
