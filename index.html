                Iceland is surrounded by the sea, so it’s no surprise that fish and seafood are an important part of Icelandic cuisine.
                 Most traditional Icelandic food revolves around fish, dairy products, bread, potatoes and lamb.
                  The roots of Icelandic cuisine come from Scandinavian cuisine after the Vikings of Northern Europe settled there in
                   the 9th century and thereafter. Today, restaurants in Reykjavik and other cities widely serve food from all over the
                    world. Many restaurants specialize in seafood, focusing on product quality rather than traditional cooking methods. 
                    Classic icelandic foods: kjötsúpa, Harðfiskur, skyr, pylsur, brennivín, hákarl, Rúgbrauð.

                Since Iceland is small, family is especially important. Icelandic households are generally larger 
                than other Nordic countries.

                Members of the extended family usually do not live together, for 
                example cousins, but uncles, aunts and grandparents usually help with childcare.

                Iceland is a Nordic country, and it is believed that Nordic Vikings lived for the first time in the 9th century. 
                The island’s connection with the Vikings can still be seen in some of its traditions.

                <br>
                The people of Iceland are proud of this heritage and have done a lot to protect it. A good example of this
                is modern Icelandic,  which is still very similar to the old Nordic language used by its first inhabitants.
